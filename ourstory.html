<h1 class="menu-titles">OUR STORY</h1>

<p>Nestled into a Birch Street nook in Roslindale Village, Sophia's Grotto has offered cozy indoor and al fresco dining since March 2005. Named after Roman actress and icon Sophia Loren, the restaurant offers traditional Italian fare, as well as an eclectic mix of Mediterranean dishes, wines and music.</p>

<p>With high ceilings, brick walls, terra cotta canopies and warm lighting,the interior emulates a traditional Tuscan trattoria. Italian and Spanish LP covers adorn the colorful unisex restroom walls. Weather permitting, the outdoor terrace, which seats 60, offers an off-street European-style dining experience.</p>

<p>The staff are friendly, low-key and competent, although somewhat laissez-faire, allowing diners ample time and privacy. Although not incredibly proactive, when requested, they dutifully respond.</p>

<p>The table seating and warm lighting lends itself to both romantic dining and social outings in which casual and formal attire are equally acceptable. The iPod play list includes The Gypsy Kings in a volume loud enough for a lively gathering and soft enough for an enjoyably intimate dinner. Tradition meets modernity as a large portrait of Sophia Loren hangs adjacent to the flat screen television, which
is usually airing a sporting event.</p>
